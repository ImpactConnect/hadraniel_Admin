# üì¶ Product Management - Development Guide (Admin App)

This document outlines the development process for the **Product Management** module in the **Admin Desktop App** for a frozen food sales inventory system. This app is built using **Flutter Desktop** with an **offline-first** architecture using **SQLite** and **Supabase** for cloud sync.

---

## üß± Objective

Allow the Admin to manage products (create, update, delete, view) per outlet. All products should be stored **locally first** and then synced to Supabase when online.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Tables

### üîπ Supabase `products` Table (Cloud)

```sql
create table products (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  product_name text not null,
  quantity numeric not null,
  unit text not null,
  cost_per_unit numeric not null,
  total_cost numeric not null,
  date_added timestamp default now(),
  last_updated timestamp,
  description text,
  outlet_id uuid not null references outlets(id),
  created_at timestamp default now()
);
```

### üîπ SQLite `products` Table (Local)

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  quantity REAL NOT NULL,
  unit TEXT NOT NULL,
  cost_per_unit REAL NOT NULL,
  total_cost REAL NOT NULL,
  date_added TEXT,
  last_updated TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  outlet_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT
);
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Steps

### 1. Product Model

Implement the `Product` class in `product_model.dart`.

- Include `fromMap`, `toMap`, `fromJson`, `toJson` methods.
- Include logic to convert between Supabase and SQLite formats.

### 2. Product Service (Local DB)

Implement CRUD operations in `product_service.dart`:

- `insertProduct()`
- `getAllProducts()`
- `getProductById()`
- `updateProduct()`
- `deleteProduct()`

### 3. Sync Logic

In `sync_service.dart`, implement:

- `fetchProductsFromSupabase()` to pull products into local DB
- `pushUnsyncedProductsToSupabase()` to push offline-created products

### 4. UI Development

#### products_screen.dart

- Display product list in a `PaginatedDataTable` or table view
- Include filter/search bar
- Each product entry should show:
  - Name, Unit, Cost/Unit, Quantity, Total Cost, Outlet, Date Added, Date Updated
- Provide buttons:
  - Add Product (opens form)
  - View Details
  - Sync Button

#### product_form_screen.dart

- Form fields: product name, quantity, unit, cost/unit, description, outlet selector, Total Cost
- Preload the product name field with some products (Chicken, Turkey, Gari, Titus, Shawa, Egg, Titus, Beef, Goat meat), the user can select from existing product list or create a new one. Also, preload the unit with (KG, PCS, Carton, Paint, Cup). The user can select from the drop down or create a new one.
- Validate fields before saving
- Submit should write to local DB and mark as unsynced

#### product_detail_popup.dart

- Show extended details of the product in a dialog
- Option to close only (admin cannot edit from this view)

---

## üîÅ Sync Considerations

- Maintain a `synced` flag in the local DB.
- Only push unsynced records.
- When pulling from Supabase, handle updates using `last_updated` timestamps.

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Admin can add/edit/delete products locally.
- [ ] All products are assigned to outlets.
- [ ] Products sync successfully to and from Supabase.
- [ ] UI supports product filtering and detailed viewing.
- [ ] All operations are offline-capable with retry sync.

---

## üìå Notes

- Use `uuid` package to generate IDs locally.
- Ensure validation for duplicate product names within the same outlet.
- Add feedback (e.g., Snackbars) after operations like add, update, delete.

Preload the Product name section with the following product name in the add new product screen, so that it is possible to select from the existing list or add a new one.
